### Detailed Module Planning

To effectively tackle the problem of predicting the veracity of narrated stories using both audio and textual data, the project will be divided into several key modules. Each module encompasses specific tasks and methodologies to ensure a comprehensive and systematic approach. Below is a detailed plan outlining each module, including the steps and techniques to be employed.

#### 1. **Audio Feature Extraction**

Capturing the acoustic characteristics of the narrated stories is crucial for deception detection. This module involves processing the raw audio data to extract meaningful features that can be utilized by the machine learning model.

##### 1.1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
- **Libraries**: Utilize libraries such as `librosa`, `pydub`, and `numpy` for audio processing.
- **Loading Audio Files**: Read audio files from the provided dataset, ensuring consistent sampling rates (e.g., 16kHz) across all recordings.
- **Normalization**: Normalize audio signals to have uniform amplitude levels, which helps in reducing variability caused by recording differences.
- **Trimming/Padding**: Ensure all audio clips are of uniform length (e.g., 3-5 minutes) by trimming longer recordings or padding shorter ones with silence.

##### 1.2. **Feature Extraction Techniques**
- **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)**:
  - **Description**: MFCCs capture the power spectrum of audio signals, emphasizing the timbral aspects of speech.
  - **Implementation**: Use `librosa.feature.mfcc` to extract a set number of coefficients (e.g., 13-40) from each audio clip.
  - **Parameters**: Set appropriate frame sizes and hop lengths to balance temporal resolution and computational efficiency.
  
- **Prosodic Features**:
  - **Pitch (Fundamental Frequency)**: Extract pitch contours to analyze intonation patterns.
  - **Energy (Intensity)**: Measure the loudness variations to detect stress or emphasis.
